## PROJECT-2 DOCUMENTATIONS

I was able to get Nginx installed with the sudo apt install and also using the sudo systemctl status nginx to verify installation
I installed mysql database management system with the following command sudo apt install mysql-server so i will be able to store and manage data for this project. and the sudo mysql command was used to log into the mysql console.
I also made installation of PHP to process code and and generate content for the web server.
the linux command was handy here because i used the to the following command(mkdir,chown,rm)to make a directory,change ownership,and remove file.the nano text editor was used create a file.
